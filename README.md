## Instructions

The objective of the game is to guess the secret word in up to 6 attempts. Each attempt must be based on a valid Portuguese word of exactly 5 characters. After each attempt, the color of the letters in the written word will determine how close you are to the answer. \
Example:

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Running

To start the project, runs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuigiSouza/wordle-br.git
cd wordle-br
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Preamble

I DO NOT OWN THE WORD LIST. This is just a 'Fan Game' made to study React and pure css so it got extracted from source code in [Term.ooo](https://term.ooo/) website. In the future, to make a more mature solution, it will be changed to my own dictionary.
